gradients in at least two (significantly) different orientations are the easiest to localize, as shown schematically in Figure 7.4a.
These intuitions can be formalized by looking at the simplest possible matching criterion for comparing two image patches i.e., their (weighted) summed square difference,
$$
E_{\mathrm{W S S D}} ( {\bf u} )=\sum_{i} w ( {\bf x}_{i} ) [ I_{1} ( {\bf x}_{i}+{\bf u} )-I_{0} ( {\bf x}_{i} ) ]^{2} \tag{7.1}
$$
where $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ are the two images being compared, $\mathbf{u}=( u, v )$ is the displacement vector, $w ( \mathbf{x} )$ is a spatially varying weighting (or window) function, and the summation $i$ is over all the pixels in the patch. Note that this is the same formulation we later use to estimate motion between complete images (Section 9.1).
When performing feature detection, we do not know which other image locations the feature will end up being matched against. Therefore, we can only compute how stable this
